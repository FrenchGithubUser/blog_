In my case, I was able to\n      do simple and double twists with backwards rotations before learning the\n      barani. I was twisting to the left backwards and somehow learned the\n      barani by twisting to the right. This can cause problems if you want to\n      combine your barani with backwards twists (barani in full out for\n      example). However please note that it is possible to combine flips with\n      different twisting directions in the same jump : if you only initiate the\n      flip when taking off, and wait before initating the twist. Some people can\n      do backflip-twist-backflip (so a triple flip) by managing to initiate and\n      stop the twist during the jump, so why not changing twist directions ?\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      After some research on the web and some experimenting with different\n      exercises, I found a solution that worked pretty well for me. It seems to\n      be a known problem among gymnasts, which is a good thing when it comes to\n      trying to fix it. The issue was that I had the feeling of twisting to the\n      left side while I was twisting to the right; because when your head is\n      upside down, what was originally on your left is now on your right. To\n      prevent this from happening, you first need to get used to the new\n      twisting side, and for that, you can delay the twist until you are not\n      upside down anymore : do 3/4 of a front flip and once your body is\n      horizontally aligned to the ground and you can see what's in front of you,\n      start twisting. Do some repetitions using this technique and once you feel\n      confortable with it, start twisting a bit earlier, and earlier and earlier\n      until you reached the timing you want.\n    </p>\n  </articleBase>\n</template>\n\n<script charset=\"utf-8\">\nimport articleBase from \"@/components/articleBase.vue\";\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    articleBase,\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n","import { render } from \"./barani-twisting-side.vue?vue&type=template&id=df1976ee\"\nimport script from \"./barani-twisting-side.vue?vue&type=script&charset=utf-8&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./barani-twisting-side.vue?vue&type=script&charset=utf-8&lang=js\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"/home/th3g3ntl3man/github/blog/node_modules/vue-loader-v16/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"sourceRoot":""}
